**Timeout:** If there is no reply within the specified time

**No Match:** It means, the user replied, but the response lookup condition didnâ€™t match

**Lookup Condition 1:** It means the user replied, and the response lookup condition also matched

As per our requirement, repeat the â€˜Send SMSâ€™ and â€˜Wait for SMS Replyâ€™ steps
