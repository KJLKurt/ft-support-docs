# How to Connect WhatsApp Cloud (Meta formally known as Facebook)

# Prerequisites with WhatsApp Cloud (Meta)

## Create a New Meta Developer App

This will create a Facebook Developer App with the WhatsApp product enabled

Next you can configure your phone numbers in the ‚ÄúWhatsapp‚Äù section of your new Facebook Developer App. Once your phone number has been added sucessfully you will get a ‚ÄúPhone Number ID‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhatsApp Business Account ID‚Äù, save these two values to use in the steps below. See the attached screenshot where to find these values

1. API Provider = Make sure you have ‚ÄúWhatsApp Cloud‚Äù selected
2. Inbox Name = Give your new Inbox a name you will recognize like ‚ÄúMy Business WhatsApp‚Äù
3. Phone Number = Enter the same phone number you have configured in the Meta Developer App
4. Phone Number ID = Enter the Phone Number ID you created earlier in this guide
5. Business Account ID = Enter the Business Account ID you created earlier in this guide
6. API Key = This is the access token for the System User you created which can access your Meta Business Account
7. Webhook Verify Token = Here you will want to put in a long 12-24 character long code. (Save this to use on the next step)

Send Webhook Notifications from Meta to your New Inbox

# Tell Meta to Send Webhook Notifications to your New Inbox

Back in your Meta Developer App navigate to the ‚ÄúConfiguration‚Äù section. On this page you will set the ‚ÄúCallbackURL‚Äù to ‚Äú[https://app1.chatcloud.ai/webhooks/whatsapp/+17145551212](https://app1.chatcloud.ai/webhooks/whatsapp/+17145551212)‚Äù

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è Please note the URL above includes your phone number with ‚Äú+‚Äù and the country code (1 for US). Replace the ‚Äú+17145551212‚Äù with the correct phone number you previously configured.

</aside>

 

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Meta only allows ONE Callback/Webhook URL per Meta Developer App. If you have or plan to have multiple WhatsApp inboxes they will all work with the same Webhook URL and messages will be routed to the correct Inbox

</aside>

Last you will need to paste a value for the ‚ÄúVerify Token‚Äù. This is the same 12-24 character long Webhook Verify Token you generated in a previous step above.
