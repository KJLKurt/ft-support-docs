# How to add tags for my Leads/Contacts by an automation flow?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When you build a form inside your system with standard fields like Firstname, Lastname, Email, and Phone to collect your users/client's information, this form is called a lead collecting form. And you are also allowed to add more fields as per your requirements.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When your users submit this form, the System will automatically create a contact/lead under your account. Sometimes, if your users submit this form multiple times, the system will duplicate contacts for each submission event. To prevent this duplication, you need to create a flow attached to your lead collecting form.
