### STEP 1: UPLOAD FILE

Upload your Contacts as CSV

### STEP 2: FIELD MAPPING

### Map CSV file fields to contact fields

1. Choose your Opt-In Statuses
2. Contact Duplication Rule

- **Match by Email**
By selecting this option your uploaded contacts will match with existing contacts in system by using email columns. And if email matched it means contact is already in system and new contact from your uploaded file will not be processed.

**- Match By Phone Number**
By selecting this option your uploaded contacts will match with existing Phone Number in system by using Phone Number column. And if Phone Number matched it means contact is already in system and new contact from your uploaded file will not be processed.

**- Match by Email or Phone Number**
By selecting this option your uploaded contacts will match with existing Email or Phone Number in system by using Email or Phone Number column. And if Phone Number or Email anyone of them is matched it means contact is already in system and new contact from your uploaded file will not be processed.

**- Match by Email and Phone Number**
By selecting this option your uploaded contacts will match with existing Email and Phone Number in system by using Email and Phone Number column. And if Phone Number and Email both of them are matched it means contact is already in system and new contact from your uploaded file will not be processed.

**- No match, create new leads**
By selecting this option your uploaded contacts will not match with existing contacts and create new contacts (you might get duplicates if contacts are already in the system)
