# My Lead collecting form is making duplicate contacts.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When you build a form inside the system with standard fields like Firstname, Lastname, Email, Phone to collect your users/clients information, this form is called a lead collecting form. And you are also allowed to add more fields as per your requirements.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When your users submit this form, the System will automatically create a contact/lead under your account. Sometimes, if your users submit this form multiple times, the system will duplicate contacts for each submission event. To prevent this duplication, you need to create a flow attached to your lead collecting form.
