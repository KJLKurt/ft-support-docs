# Where will I get my users submitted form information?

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ When you will create a form inside the system with some basic fields like First Name, Last Name, Email, Phone, etc. and your users will submit that form to contact you, at that same time the system will automatically create a lead/contact for that user. Sometimes, you may need to collect additional information like their hobby, or business description.
