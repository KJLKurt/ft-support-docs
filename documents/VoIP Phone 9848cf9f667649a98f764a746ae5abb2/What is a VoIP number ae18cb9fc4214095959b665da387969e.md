# ****What is a VoIP number?****

A VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone number is the number assigned to you when you sign up for a VoIP service. It’s basically the string of digits you enter on a dial pad to make a call, much like with traditional landlines. But unlike its older counterpart, a VoIP phone number can be used to call from any internet-enabled device, such as a desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone, and of course, a VoIP phone.

VoIP phones don’t require much of a learning curve or technical know-how. Most of them are essentially plug-and-play instruments in that you can just plug your IP phone into a local available network (LAN) port, and the device will register itself on the VoIP network. From there, you can use your VoIP number like a regular phone number.
