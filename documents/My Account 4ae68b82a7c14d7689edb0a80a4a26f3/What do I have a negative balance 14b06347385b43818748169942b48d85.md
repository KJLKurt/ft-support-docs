# What do I have a negative balance?

Recently we have launched new version with new subscription packages. If you have a lifetime subscription, you won't be charged for any feature included with your subscription. 

Since we released some new features not included with your subscription, and you want to avail them, then the system will charge an amount for that.

Please, navigate to â†’ account/profile/billing to check the billing history, purchased items, and price list.
