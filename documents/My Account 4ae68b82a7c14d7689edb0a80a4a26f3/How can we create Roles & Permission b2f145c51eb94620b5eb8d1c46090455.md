# How can we create Roles & Permission?

# Create Role & Permission

Create different **Access Keys** for different types of users. When you want to give an Assistant, Web Designer, Developer, or Sales person different access to the system you will use roles. **Access Keys** are a group of **Permissions** that control what a user can/can't do and see in the system. The first role **All Access** has been created for you automatically.

1. First you have to click on the setting tab from the most left side
